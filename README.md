# Project meanLeanFreakGoat's Off Leash Location Finder, AKA Wanderdog!

This application draws from public information to obtain free trails, camp grounds, and parks for your 4-legged pooch! Also provides weather data for your location!

## Getting Started

* [Click Here!](https://kimiinglet.github.io/meanLeanFreakGoat/)

These instructions will help you locate the perfect spot to spend time with your pups.

As dog owners, we wanted to find areas in the US where we can camp/hike with our dogs off-leash, so that we can spend quality time with our dogs and allow them to explore nature.

## How Wanderdog works
We used Recreation's API to return campsites where dogs are allowed. We also searched for state parks and forests where you can visit with your dog off-leash.
